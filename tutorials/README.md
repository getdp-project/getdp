# GetDP Tutorial

The following tutorials provide a progressive introduction to GetDP. Each
tutorial builds on the previous ones, introducing new modeling concepts,
formulation techniques and solver features. They are designed to be studied in
order:

1. **Electrostatics**: Scalar potential formulation, Lagrange elements,
   Dirichlet boundary conditions.
2. **Thermal**: Heat equation with conduction and convection, Neumann and
   Robin boundary conditions, steady-state and transient analyses, periodic
   constraints.
3. **Magnetostatics**: Vector potential formulation, infinite elements,
   nonlinear materials with Newton-Raphson and Picard iterations.
4. **Magneto-quasistatics**: Eddy currents, frequency- and time-domain
   analyses, axisymmetric models.
5. **Full wave**: Edge elements, absorbing boundary conditions,
   Dirichlet constraint through an auxiliary resolution.
6. **Global quantities**: Global basis functions, floating potentials,
   electrode charges and capacitances.
7. **Coupled problems**: a-v formulation with global currents and voltages,
   magneto-thermal coupling, staggered resolution.
8. **Circuit coupling**: Lumped circuit elements, network constraints,
   Kirchhoff's laws, tree-cotree gauging in 3D.
9. **Template library**: Generic formulation library, transformer with
   magnetically coupled circuits, stranded coils, ferromagnetic laminations.
10. **Gauging**: Tree-cotree vs. Coulomb gauge, 3D transformer model with
   global coil basis functions.

Each [tutorial directory](https://gitlab.onelab.info/getdp/getdp/tree/master/tutorials/)
contains a `.geo` file (geometry and mesh), a `.pro` file (finite element model)
and a `README.md` with instructions. The `.pro` and `.geo` files are heavily
commented -- the comments are the tutorial.

All tutorials can be run interactively with Gmsh (open the `.pro` file, then
press "Run") or from the command line (see the `README.md` in each directory).

## Further reading

The tutorials cover a fair amount of the underlying mathematics of the finite
element method and of the physics of the problems they address, but they do not
aim to be a self-contained treatise on either. The following references are
useful companions, grouped from most directly relevant to the tutorials' main
topic to more general background.
